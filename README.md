# Stockticker-DiscordRPC
Displays the current stock price of your favorite stock (Mine is Blackberry, WSB, of course.) as your Discord Rich Presence, because why not!

I made this as a joke, as I purchased a few shares of NET (Cloudflare), and now Blackberry, and wanted to show my "loyalty" by making my rich presence the current stock price.

To run, simply copy the repo into a folder, (I'm assuming you already have NodeJS and Git Installed.) and run ```npm i```, then run ```node index.js```.
To quit / stop, press: ```ctrl + c```

### Demonstration of RPC (Rich Presence In Action)
(Note: Yahoo stocks don't reflect after-hours price changes, so that's why it's a cent off in the next picture.)

Thank you @Nexure for helping me debug my code! I was a bit rusty with JS before working on this project as my last JS project was an old music RPC plugin lol.
