# Stockticker-DiscordRPC
Displays the current stock price of NET (Cloudflare) as your Discord Rich Presence, because why not!

I made this as a joke, as I purchased a few shares of NET (Cloudflare) and wanted to show my "loyalty" by making my rich presence the current stock price.

(Note: Yahoo stocks don't reflect after-hours price changes, so that's why it's a cent off in the next picture.)

Thank you @Nexure for helping me debug my code! I was a bit rusty with JS before working on this project as my last JS project was an old music RPC plugin lol.
